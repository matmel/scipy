SciPy 0.18.0 is the culmination of X months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.17.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.2-3.4 and NumPy 1.6.2 or greater.


New features
============

`scipy.interpolate` improvements
--------------------------------

Cubic spline interpolation is now available via `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline`.
This class implements a straightforward algorithm which determines coefficients
of cubic polynomials on given segments from continuity of the first and second
derivatives. It should be easier to understand and use than B-spline
interpolation.
